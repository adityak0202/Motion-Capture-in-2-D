# Motion-Capture-in-2-D
Perform motion capture on any dance/video file on the internet.

This project involves tracking and recording movements using 2D motion capture techniques. By analyzing input from video or sensor data, we detect and map key body points and their movements. The implementation uses algorithms such as optical flow or keypoint detection (OpenCV) to track and visualize motion over time. It can be applied in animation, sports analytics, or virtual reality.
